# Project Setup

This project is designed for deployment using Docker and requires a PostgreSQL database. Follow the steps below to set up the project.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**  
   Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.  
   - [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Node.js and PM2**  
   Install Node.js, and use `npm` to install PM2 globally for process management:
   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```

---

## Database Setup

To set up the PostgreSQL database using Docker, refer to the following tutorial:  
[How to Create a PostgreSQL Database in Docker](https://www.commandprompt.com/education/how-to-create-a-postgresql-database-in-docker/)

### Using `compose.yml`

1. Use the provided `compose.yml` file to start the database:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will launch the PostgreSQL database in the background as a Docker container, allowing your application to connect to it.

---

## Application Setup

### Copy Configuration

Copy the contents of `ecosystem.config.js` to the root directory of your project.

### Start Application

To start the application in production mode using PM2, run:
```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
```

This command initializes the application with the configuration specified in `ecosystem.config.js`, managing the app processes in production mode.
