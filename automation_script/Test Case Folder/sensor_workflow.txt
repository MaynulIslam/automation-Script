        HOW SENSOR TABLES WORK - EXPLAINED SIMPLY
================================================================================

Think of it like a TOY STORE and YOUR TOY BOX at home!

================================================================================
1. SensorTypes Table = THE TOY CATALOG (Library of All Possible Toys)
================================================================================

This is like a big catalog that shows ALL the different types of toys that exist
in the world. It tells you:
  - What the toy is called
  - What it looks like
  - What it can do
  - Its size and features

EXAMPLE from SensorTypes:
  ID: 1
  Name: CO (Carbon Monoxide)
  Range: 100 ppm
  Unit: ppm
  Max: 100

This is saying: "We have a sensor type that can measure Carbon Monoxide gas
up to 100 ppm. It's like having a toy car that can go up to 100 mph."


================================================================================
2. DeviceSensorMasters Table = YOUR TOY BOX (Actual Toys You Own)
================================================================================

This is YOUR personal toy box at home. It shows:
  - Which toys YOU actually have
  - Which room/device the toy is in
  - What order you play with them (priority)
  - Where in the room they are placed (location)

EXAMPLE from DeviceSensorMasters:
  Sensor ID: 24
  Device ID: 13 (like Room #13 in your house)
  Location: "Gas 1"
  Priority: 1 (first sensor to check)
  Sensor Type: 1 (this points to the catalog!)

This is saying: "In room 13, at location 'Gas 1', I have the #1 priority
sensor, and it's the TYPE of sensor from catalog ID 1 (the CO 100ppm sensor)."


================================================================================
3. HOW THEY CONNECT (The Link)
================================================================================

DeviceSensorMasters.sensor_type → SensorTypes.id

Think: "My toy box has a TOY CAR, and sensor_type=5 tells me to look at
       page 5 in the catalog to see what kind of car it is!"

REAL EXAMPLE:

  My Device (Room 90):
  └─ Sensor at "Integral" location
     └─ sensor_type = 7
        └─ Go look at SensorTypes where id=7
           └─ Found! It's "NO (Nitric Oxide) 1000 ppm"

So now I know: "Room 90 has a Nitric Oxide sensor that can measure up to
1000 ppm at the Integral location!"


================================================================================
4. WHY TWO TABLES? (Why not just one?)
================================================================================

Imagine if EVERY toy in your toy box came with its own instruction manual!
That would be:
  ✗ A LOT of repeated paper (waste of space!)
  ✗ Hard to update (if you change the manual, you'd have to change it
    everywhere!)

INSTEAD:
  ✓ Keep ONE master catalog (SensorTypes) with all the details
  ✓ Your toy box (DeviceSensorMasters) just says "I have toy #7" and points
    to the catalog
  ✓ If the catalog updates, everyone automatically sees the new info!


================================================================================
5. REAL WORLD EXAMPLE
================================================================================

DEVICE #90 has these sensors:

Sensor 1:
  - Location: "Integral"
  - Priority: 0 (checked first)
  - sensor_type: 7
  - Look up type 7 in catalog → NO (Nitric Oxide) 1000 ppm

Sensor 2:
  - Location: "Gas 1"
  - Priority: 1 (checked second)
  - sensor_type: 1
  - Look up type 1 in catalog → CO (Carbon Monoxide) 100 ppm

So Device #90 checks:
  1st → Nitric Oxide sensor at "Integral"
  2nd → Carbon Monoxide sensor at "Gas 1"


================================================================================
6. PRIORITY (The Order They're Checked)
================================================================================

Think of priority like a lunch line at school:
  - Priority 0 = First in line (gets checked first)
  - Priority 1 = Second in line
  - Priority 2 = Third in line
  And so on...

Lower number = More important = Checked first!


================================================================================
7. LOCATION (Where the Sensor Is)
================================================================================

This is like saying where in your room the toy is:
  - "Integral" = Built into the device (like a built-in speaker)
  - "Gas 1" = External sensor port 1
  - "Gas 2" = External sensor port 2
  - "Remote" = Far away sensor connected by cable


================================================================================
SUMMARY (The Simple Version)
================================================================================

SensorTypes = Big catalog of all sensor types that exist
              (What CAN exist)

DeviceSensorMasters = Your actual sensors in your devices
                      (What you ACTUALLY have)

Connection = sensor_type number points to the catalog ID
             (Like "I have toy #7, look it up in the catalog!")

Priority = What order to check them
           (0 is first, 1 is second, etc.)

Location = Where the sensor is placed
           (Integral, Gas 1, Remote, etc.)
